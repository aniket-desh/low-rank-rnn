# a low-rank recurrent neural network

this repository contains code for training and analyzing a low-rank recurrent neural network. the motivating goal is to train an RNN to track an OU process, and study the emergence of low-rank structure in the connectivity matrix of the form $$J = gW - (b/N) 11^T + m u v^T$$.
